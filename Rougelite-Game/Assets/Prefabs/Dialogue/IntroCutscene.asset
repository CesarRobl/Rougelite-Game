  - Thou sodden-witted lord! Thou hast no more brain than I have in mine elbows!
  - Your brain is as dry as the remainder biscuit after voyage
  - If you spend word for word with me, I shall make your wit bankrupt
  - He has not so much brain as ear-wax
  - Away, you mouldy rogue, away
  - I do desire that we may be better strangers
  - You are as a candle, the better burnt out
  - Drunkenness is his best virtue, for he will be swine drunk, and in his sleep
    he does little harm, save to his bedclothes about him
  - "You are now sailed into the north of my lady\u2019s opinion, where you will
    hang like an icicle on a Dutchman\u2019s beard"
  - "Foul spoken coward, that thund\u2019rest with thy tongue, and with thy weapon
    nothing dares perform"
  - "There\u2019s small choice in rotten apples"
  - Saucy lackey!
