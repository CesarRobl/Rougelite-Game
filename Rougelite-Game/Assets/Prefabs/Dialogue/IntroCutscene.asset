  - "Working together every day, the five brothers Jim, Matt, Chad, Ben, and the
    youngest, Tyler, do their best to serve up their world famous burgers cooked
    in peanut oil, to all their hungry customers. Everyone from all over the world
    comes to one of their restaurants for a quality burger cooked to perfection,
    and great service with a smile! Because of the hard work of the brothers, the
    Five Guy\u2019s restaurants became world famous! "
  - 'Not all the attention was good, though. Owners of other restaurants became jealous
    of the success that the Five Guys restaurants earned. Wanting the success that
    the Five Guys restaurants had for themselves, these corrupt crooked cooks burst
    into the Five Guys after hours using dark magic! '
  - "The quartet of criminal cooks kidnapped the four older brothers. \u201CNow we
    will have you cook for us!\u201D they said as they decided to each take one brother.
    They planned to keep the brothers in their restaurants  and  make them give up
    the recipes that Five Guys became famous for. "
  - "Not wanting his brothers to be taken, Tyler heroically jumped into the portal
    after the evil cooks. Taking only a spatula as a form of defense, he steels himself
    to fight against the forces of the four failed fry cooks. \u201CDon\u2019t worry
    guys! I\u2019m going to save you!\u201D He shouts as he jumps through the portal!\t"
